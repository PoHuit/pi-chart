# pi-chart: EVE Online Planetary Interaction chart
Copyright (c) 2018 Po Huit

This little chunk of code uses the EVE Static Data Export
(thanks Fuzzworks!) and PyCairo (thanks Cairo folks!) to
produce a nigh-unreadable chart describing Planetary
Interaction flows. It is written primarily as a demo of
working with the SDE, and is fairly useless as it stands.
